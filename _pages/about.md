üìä I'm an E-Business Analyst with a master's degree in E-Business and Innovation from Lancaster University, where I specialized in creating innovative solutions that improve information systems and enhance the customer experience.

As a researcher at Lancaster University, I worked on the project Phoenix Takes Flight, exploring usability and scalability challenges with community-based health support via social prescribing. I focused on social prescribing, information systems, and social inequality, using cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to conduct data analysis and generate insights.

As a marketing manager at Newtown Science Festival, I was in charge of all the marketing for the festival, including strategy, copywriting, design, and photography. I created and implemented effective digital marketing campaigns that reached and engaged different audiences, increasing the attendance and awareness of the festival.

I am a lifelong learner, constantly seeking new knowledge and skills. I am currently exploring programming languages, including Python, and studying Japanese. Additionally, I enjoy cooking Mexican food and playing video games. I am deeply committed to excellence, and I thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments. I am eager to leverage my skills and expertise to drive success and deliver value to your organization.
