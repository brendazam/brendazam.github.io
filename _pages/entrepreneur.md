Technology is the new magic of the stories.🔮 Create things out of nowhere, being able to create robotics, medicines, essays and now even music, novels or whatever we can possibily think. I felt inspired by technology back in 2014, when I joined my first job at the streaming company Ibero Live 📹. 


The start of my entreneurship 👾
------
Worked in Ibero live for over a year with amazing people who taught me how easy it was to reach technology, specifically in this case web design and streaming. Being in Mexico studying a career in Communications I thought technology was not my path, since I consider myself a very creative, subjective and, well, communication's focused person 🙌🏼. My first mentor then thought me about digital marketing and the importance of personal branding, teaching me how to stand out, I was hooked.


In 2015 I decided to start my startup with a coworker, we called it DevBranding, joining our university's incubator for small companies for a period of 6 months 🐣. DevBranding main focus was to support entrepreneurs like us, who had no technical skills, to create a personal branding online. We created videos and a platform were we would upload content on how to create personal branding, but we still needed to attract people in the real world.

Open Hack Nights 👩🏻‍💻
------

I've always consider myself a community person, a leader, someone destined to guide people to make the best of themselves, pretty much a people helper 🤝, so we decided to start a community of entrepreneurs, following the guide of Fuck Up Nights, Epic Queen and other startups based in networking. What was different with us? Open hack would be Open to everyone, allowing 5 people first comes first serve to give a presentation about their startup 🦾, project 📚 or just an idea 💡 they thought would be good so the rest of the community gives feedback, opinions or even show interest in joining if possible to the project 👔.  

We did Open Hack Nights as a first step for every entrepreneur to show up and join the community, hosting most of the events in different universities in Puebla City who would join and invite their students to present their ideas, do some networking and chill with pizza 🍕 and drinks. We kept it going for almost 3 years, from 2015 to 2017, expanding to 3 different cities in Mexico and having more than 500 people in our community 📣.
