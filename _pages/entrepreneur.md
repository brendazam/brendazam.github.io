Technology is the new magic of the stories.🔮 Create things out of nowhere, being able to create robotics, medicines, essays and now even music, novels or whatever we can possibily think. I felt inspired by technology back in 2014, when I joined my first job at the streaming company Ibero Live 📹. 

The start of my entreneurship 👾 
------
Worked in Ibero live for over a year with amazing people who taught me how easy it was to reach technology, specifically in this case web design and streaming. Being in Mexico studying a career in Communications I thought technology was not my path, since I consider myself a very creative, subjective and, well, communication's focused person 🙌🏼. My first mentor then thought me about digital marketing and the importance of personal branding, teaching me how to stand out, I was hooked.

In 2015 I decided to start my startup with a coworker, we called it DevBranding, joining our university's incubator for small companies for a period of 6 months 🐣. DevBranding main focus was to support entrepreneurs like us, who had no technical skills, to create a personal branding online. We created videos and a platform were we would upload content on how to create personal branding, but we still needed to attract people in the real world.

I've always consider myself a community person, a leader, someone destined to guide people to make the best of themselves, pretty much a people helper 🤝, so we decided to start a community of entrepreneurs, following the guide of Fuck Up Nights, Epic Queen and other startups based in networking. What was different with us? Open hack would be Open to everyone, allowing 5 people first comes first serve to give a presentation about their startup 🦾, project 📚 or just an idea 💡 they thought would be good so the rest of the community gives feedback, opinions or even show interest in joining if possible to the project 👔.  

We did Open Hack Nights as a first step for every entrepreneur to show up and join the community, hosting most of the events in different universities in Puebla City who would join and invite their students to present their ideas, do some networking and chill with pizza 🍕 and drinks. We kept it going for almost 3 years, from 2015 to 2017, expanding to 3 different cities in Mexico and having more than 500 people in our community 📣. 


Evolution of DevBranding to Setih ❮ ❯ ![profile](/images/setih1.jpeg){: .align-right width="300px"}

During the process of stablishing our startup, we got the support of a mentor who was part of a education startup that was part of YCombinator in Sillicon Valley, the startup Platzi was the pioneer of coding education for Latinamerica, offering courses to learn back-end, front-end and digital marketing in spanish online. We were very lucky, I even provided several talks in the platform about personal branding, and one of the advices of our mentors was "it all starts with the name". We decided to change the vision of DevBranding to provide more support in the coding process, and with that we decided to change our name to Setih. ![profile](/images/platzitalk1.jpeg)


Raising the top
------

Managed to present in national events, organized a TEDx with my university at the time and started developing my skills in marketing and design. In 2016 was invited to YC Women Day in Sillicon Valley. Setih was demanding time and attention, which made difficult to perform as expected in my studies. We were still a team of 2, and my partner was offered a full scholarship to study in one of the best universities in Mexico, a great opportunity that decided to take. We started focusing more in our studies since I was in my last year and my partner moved to a different city and was starting his studies. 

After a year, in 2017, we realized that it was not possible for us to continue with the startup since both our visions were changing about what we wanted to do with Setih. ![profile](/images/talk4.jpeg){: .align-right width="300px"}

How to close a startup

Setih was the most important project I ever worked on, not just as building a community, create a service, manage stakeholders and learn everything about a business, but also how to communicate and make hard decisions with your team. I made the decision to leave Setih cause there were new projects for it that were not alinged with my goals. 

Being an entrepreneur is having nights without sleep building a dream, having hope and work as hard as you can to make a change for good. I absolutely loved building our community and support people to connect and give them advice on how to take those first steps. 

I decided to focus on finishing my degree and was very proud of myself for making it happen, I belive it was an experience that made me grow so much as a person and as a professional, maybe not all entrpereneurships are meant to be succesfull, but I'll never say that I didnt try it for being scared of failure. ![profile](/images/profile3.jpeg){: .align-right width="300px"}
