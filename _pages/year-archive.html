Technology is the new magic of the stories.🔮 Create things out of nowhere, being able to create robotics, medicines, essays and now even music, novels or whatever we can possibily think. I felt inspired by technology back in 2014, when I joined my first job at the streaming company Ibero Live 📹. 


##The start of my entreneurship 👾##
------
Worked in Ibero live for over a year with amazing people who taught me how easy it was to reach technology, specifically in this case web design and streaming. Being in Mexico studying a career in Communications I thought technology was not my path, since I consider myself a very creative, subjective and, well, communication's focused person 🙌🏼. My first mentor then thought me about digital marketing and the importance of personal branding, teaching me how to stand out, I was hooked.

In 2015 I decided to start my startup with a coworker, we called it DevBranding, joining our university's incubator for small companies for a period of 6 months 🐣. DevBranding main focus was to support entrepreneurs like us, who had no technical skills, to create a personal branding online. We created videos and a platform were we would upload content on how to create personal branding, but we still needed to attract people in the real world.

I've always consider myself a community person, a leader, someone destined to guide people to make the best of themselves, pretty much a people helper. 🤝
