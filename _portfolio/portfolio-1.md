In this project, I analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I searched for the golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

My search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I also filtered, grouped, and ordered data.
