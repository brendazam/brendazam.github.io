Technology is the new magic of the stories. Create things out of nowhere, being able to create robotics, medicines, essays and now even music, novels or whatever we can possibily think. I felt inspired by technology back in 2014, when I joined my first job at the streaming company Ibero Live. 


The start of my entreneurship
------
Worked in Ibero live for over a year with amazing people who thought me how easy it was to reach technology, specifically in this case web design and streaming. Being in Mexico studying a career in Communications I thought technology was not my path, since I consider myself a very creative, subjective and, well, communication's focused person. My first mentor then thought me about digital marketing and the importance of personal branding, teaching me how to stand out, I was hooked.

In 2015 I decided to start my startup with a coworker, we called it DevBranding, joining our university's incubator for small companies for a period of 6 months. DevBranding main focus was to support entrepreneurs like us, who had no technical skills, to create a personal branding online. We created videos and a platform were we would upload content on how to create personal branding, but we still needed to attract people in the real world.
